<h1>Introduction</h1>
This page contains a debrief for a project in probabilistic reasoning, in which you participated in 2018.
In the session you completed a total of six tasks, and a debrief questionnaire. Most tasks (referred to as "Jar-tasks" and "Box-tasks"), are tasks in which you gathered information before reaching a decision (i.e., information sampling tasks).
